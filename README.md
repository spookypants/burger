# burger
A burger eating app created with Express, Handlebars, and MySQL

### Currently Non-functional
Theoretically, this app allows a user to visit a virtual restuarant (Gabe's Ballin' Burger Bar) and, if hungry, order a special burger from the menu. Ordered burgers then populate under the "Order Your Burger" zone for confirmation. When the order is confirmed, the cashier submits the order to the kitchen, and the burger order is then directed to the "Pick Up Your Burger" zone where the customer can then digitally consume the burger.

### Unfortunately
While full of theoretically sound code, this application has a number of issues, including: a lack of functional CSS (not even Bootstrap seems to work), and the application itself does not appear to register orders or populate them into the Order/Pick Up zones.

With more time, this application could become fully functional, however its lack of functionality procludes effective deployment. Many of the burgers on the menu sound pretty delicious, though.
