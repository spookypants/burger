# burger
A burger eating app created with Express, Handlebars, and MySQL

### Using This App
This app allows a user to visit a virtual restuarant (Gabe's Ballin' Burger Bar) and, if hungry, order a special burger from the menu. Ordered burgers then populate under the "Order Your Burger" zone for confirmation. When the order is confirmed, the cashier submits the order to the kitchen, and the burger order is then directed to the "Pick Up Your Burger" zone where the customer can then digitally consume the burger. Yum!
